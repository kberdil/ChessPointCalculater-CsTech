This repository is for an eclipse project. You can download and run with the Eclipse. <br />
Input files must be in the project folder. <br />

Or, you can download the "src/chesspoint/cstech" folder for only getting source files. <br />
In this case, you should have input files in this directory. You can compile and run the program from the command line: <br />
javac -d . *.java <br />
java chesspoint.cstech Main <br />

Program gets all the .txt files at the folder. (There must not be any txt files at the folder other than inputs)  <br />
Program prints all results as follows:  <br />
"Input name - siyah: points for black pieces - beyaz: points for white pieces"  <br />
Example:  <br />
board1.txt &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Siyah: 135.0 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyaz: 134.5  <br />
board2.txt &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Siyah: 116.0 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyaz: 123.0  <br />
